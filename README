xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

### Prerequisites
- RISC-V GNU toolchain
- QEMU

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6
### Commands
```bash
make         # Build the OS
make clean   # Clean build artifacts
make qemu    # Run in QEMU
